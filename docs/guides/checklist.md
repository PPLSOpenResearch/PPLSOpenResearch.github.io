## Doing experiment/analysis

_Upcoming_

## Sharing data

* Did I remove senstive data or personal identifiers?
* Did I prep my data files in a commonly-accessible format (preferably CSV)?
* Did I document my column names in a metafile?
* Did I explain what values mean what in a metafile?
* Did I explain how the data was collected in a metafile, in a way that someone else can replicate this procedure?
* Did I store it in an open and safe (preferably permanent) place but I won't arbitarily move it?
* If publishing data with a paper, did I attach the paper (or link to the paper)?
* Did I include a proper license for my data (this is very important if you do want people to use your data)?
