# Six pillars of open research


## Open data

Open data is the process of releasing both raw and processed data from your experiments, enabling others to analyse it without restriction

- FAIR principles
  - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, re-usable
- Data citation
- Data packaging
  - Data packages are containers for describing and sharing accompanying data files, and typically comprise a metadata file describing the features and context of a dataset
- Sharing sensitive and proprietary data
- Notebooks
  - Reproducible analysis is aided by the use of literate programming, container technology, and virtualization. In addition to sharing your code and data, also share your Jupyter notebooks, Docker - images, or other analysis materials or software dependencies.
- Licensing data

## Open access

Open access is the model under which papers are available for anyone to read without having to pay, and that license allows secondary use such as text-mining.

**Platinum/Diamond Open Access**
- Freely available from publisher
- No payment of a subscription fee or licence

**Gold Open Access**
- Freely available from publisher
- Author pays a fee (article processing charge â€“ APC)

**Green Open Access**
- Made available by author(s)

## Open methodology

An open methodology is to allow other researchers to repeat the work and apply it elsewhere.

- Pre-registration
  - [OSF](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg)
  - [As.predicted](https://aspredicted.org/)

## Open software and source

Open source generally refers to open and free access to the blueprint of a product; applied to software, it refers to the source code.

- Tools
  - GitHub (maintain, share, and collaborate on research software/code)
- Documentation of code!
  - Why did you do something?
  - README
- License
- Citation
  - Cite whenever software has been integral to your research

## Open peer review

Open peer review is about transforming the peer review process; it is about making peer review a collaborative process between authors and reviewers; it is about constructive criticism, but with the goal of helping the authors to get published.

## Open education

Open education refers to the open and free availability of educational resources. This does not mean that you cannot charge for education - no one can make the tutor work for free - but the resources that are used to educate can be made freely available.
