Open research data is data that can be freely accessed, reused, remixed and redistributed.
Ideally, open data have no restrictions on reuse or redistribution, and are appropriately *licensed* as such.
However, to protect the identity of human subjects, special or limited *restrictions* of access should be set with care.

Openly sharing data exposes it to inspection, forming the basis for research verification and reproducibility, and opens up a pathway to wider collaboration.
In order to make findings/studies replicable, or at least reproducible or reusable in any other way, the best practice recommendation for research data is to be as open and [FAIR](https://www.force11.org/fairprinciples) as possible:

The FAIR principles put a specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use data or any digital object, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals.

## Data packaging

* Containers for describing and sharing accompanying data files, and typically comprise a [metadata file](https://www.cessda.eu/Training/Training-Resources/Library/Data-Management-Expert-Guide/2.-Organise-Document/Documentation-and-metadata) describing the features and context of a dataset, e.g. creation information, provenance, size, format type, field definitions, as well as any relevant contextual files, such as data creation scripts or textual documentation
  * Data outlive their original purpose and be taken out of their original context (library catalog) so the context has to be documented.
  * Document how the data was gathered. If this information is described in an associated research article, make sure that all the necessary information is given in the article.
  * Structuring metadata about datasets in a standard, machine-readable way encourages the promotion, shareability, and reuse of data.

## Data publishing

* Supplemental material associated with a research article, typically with the data files hosted by the publisher of the article.
* Hosting data on a publicly-available website, with files available for download (OSF)
* Depositing data in a repository that has been developed to support data publication, e.g., [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org/)
* Institutional research data repository, or your research groupâ€™s established data management facilities.

## Data citation

* Data citation services help research communities discover, identify, and cite research data (and often other research objects) with confidence
* This typically involves the creation and allocation of Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) and accompanying metadata through services such as [DataCite](https://www.datacite.org)

## Sharing sensitive and proprietary data

* When collecting, using and sharing research data, ethical considerations and legal obligations guide the way.
* Ethics are an integral part of a research project, from the conceptual stage of the research proposal to the end of a research project. So already before data collection you experimental design underwent the ethical review at your institution and you specified how you plan to share your data
* The [CESSDA Expert Tour Guide on Data Management](https://www.cessda.eu/Training/Training-Resources/Library/Data-Management-Expert-Guide/5.-Protect/Ethics-and-data-protection) provides information and practical examples on how to share personal data and on copyright and database issues across the European countries.
