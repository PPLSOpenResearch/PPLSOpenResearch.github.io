# How-to: Pre-registration

Oct 21st, 14:10-15:00 (BST)
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Speaker

[**Alex Lorson**](https://alex-lorson.github.io), PhD student in Linguistics, PPLS Open Research Facilitator

## Event Description

In this event we will briefly discuss what a pre-registration is and what it's for. We will then demonstrate how to start a pre-registration ([OSF](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg) and [As.predicted](https://aspredicted.org/)) and guide you through the important points. The remainder of the workshop is hands-on and you can decide between two group activities. You can either choose to:

- Work together through an As.predicted pre-registration using a toy-example experiment, or
- Work on your own As.predicted pre-registration for your own research

In both cases you will be able to interact with fellow researchers, and we are there along the way to answer all questions you might have!

## Drop-in session

We run a drop-in session on Oct 28th, 14-15:00 BST.
If you have any questions about doing your own pre-registration please don't hesitate to come.
