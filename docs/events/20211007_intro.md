We will discuss incentives to participate in Open Research as well as possible barriers that a researcher unfamiliar with Open Research might face. This event will be very interactive with lots of opportunities for you to ask questions you might have related to Open Research. Everyone is welcome to join us, no matter if you just started your academic career or if you are an established researcher. We are looking forward to welcoming you!
