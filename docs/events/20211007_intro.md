# Open Research: whatâ€™s in it for me?

{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Speaker

Melissa Thye (University of Edinburgh)

## Event Description

With our first event **what's in it for me**, Melissa Thye, a PhD student in Psychology, is giving a talk on Introduction to Open Research practices.
Particularly, Melissa is going to share her experience in doing registered reports - what the biggest obstacles are and how she found everything worthwhile in the end.

We will also discuss fear in openly sharing your working code or analysis, and make available the resources the school and the university currently offer.
