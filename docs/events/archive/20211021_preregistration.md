# How-to: Pre-registration

Oct 21st, 14:10-15:00 (BST)
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Speaker

[**Alex Lorson**](https://alex-lorson.github.io), PhD student in Linguistics, PPLS Open Research Facilitator

## Event Description

In this event we will discuss what a pre-registration is and what it's for. We will then demonstrate how to start a pre-registration ([OSF](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg) and [As.predicted](https://aspredicted.org/)) and guide you through the important points. 

## Drop-in session

We run a drop-in session on Oct 28th, 14-15:00 BST.

This part is there for your questions and for you to start a pre-registration. You can either choose to:

- Work together through an As.predicted pre-registration using a toy-example experiment, or
- Work on your own As.predicted pre-registration for your own research, and

In both cases you will be able to interact with fellow researchers, and we are there along the way to answer all questions you might have!
