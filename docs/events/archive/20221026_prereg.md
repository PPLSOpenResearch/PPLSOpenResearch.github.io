# Pre-registration Workshop

Oct 26th, 15:00-16:00 (BST), 3.10/3.11 DSB
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Speaker

[**Georgia-Ann Carter**](https://gacarter.github.io/), CDT in NLP PhD student, PPLS Open Research Facilitator

## Event Description

In this event we will discuss what a pre-registration is and what it's for. We will then demonstrate how to start a pre-registration ([OSF](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg) and [As.predicted](https://aspredicted.org/)) and guide you through the important points.

As a hands-on workshop, you will have chance to either:

- Work together through an OSF pre-registration using a toy-example experiment, or
- Work on your own OSF pre-registration for your own research, and

In both cases you will be able to interact with fellow researchers, and we are there along the way to answer all questions you might have!
