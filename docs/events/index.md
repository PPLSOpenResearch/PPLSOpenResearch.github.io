# Events

We organise the following events regularly every year:

- **Blitz Talk**: Quick introduction to open research practices, how it benefits you as well as the scientific community as a whole.
- **Introduction to Pre-registrations**: Introduction to pre-registrations, and how it helps you plan and execute your research
- **Introduction to Registered Reports**: Introduction to registered reports, an increasingly popular route to publication that focuses on your methodological soundness. 
You can get published as long as your research plan is accepted and you follow through with your plan. 
- **GitHub Workshop**: How to use GitHub to track changes in your research files and directories, and how to use it to collaborate on a project and share the results

Watch this space for the exact dates. You can also browse [the archive of past events]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/archive/index.md %}), which contained many materials used in previous events.
