## What is code review?
Code review is the process of methodically and systematically checking over code after it has been written.
- [From a software development angle](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-code-review/)
- [From a researcher's viewpoint](https://debruine.github.io/talks/CompCogSci-2023/)

## Debut of Peer Code Review: January 2024

Given the upcoming conference deadlines that many of us are working towards, we’re excited to invite you to make use of our new Pre-Conference Peer Code Review program. 

You can submit your codebase to our Open Research team for reviewing any of the following:
1. Does it run?
    - Language-independent review
    - Receive feedback within 24 hours
2. Is it reproducible?
   - Language-independent review
   - Receive feedback in 48-72 hours
3. Is it auditable and understandable?
   - Language-dependent review
   - Receive feedback in 1 week
4. Does it follow best practices?
   - Language-dependent review
   - Receive feedback in 1-2 weeks

For language-dependent review, our current team can help with projects using Python, R, PHP, MatLab, C++, Java, Javascript, TypeScript, Linux, Docker, Singularity, and HTML/CSS.  

Please ensure that your review package includes: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ✓ A README file that describes the project; specifies credit and licensing

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ✓ Any outputs that the reviewers should try to reproduce

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ✓ All data used to create the outputs to be reproduced

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ✓ All code necessary to recreate the outputs

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ✓ A main script that runs any subscripts in the relevant order

We look forward to hearing from you and helping you with your submissions!
