## What is code review?
Code review is the process of methodically and systematically checking over code after it has been written.
- [From a software development angle](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-is-code-review/)
- [From a researcher's viewpoint](https://debruine.github.io/talks/CompCogSci-2023/)

## Pre-conference Peer Code Review: January 2024

Given the upcoming conference deadlines that many of us are working towards, we’re excited to invite you to make use of our new Pre-Conference Peer Code Review program. 

You can submit your codebase to our Open Research team for reviewing any of the following:
<ol>
  <li>
    <dl>
      <dt> Does it run? </dt>
      <dd>- Language-independent review </dd>
      <dd>- Receive feedback within 24 hours </dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dl>
      <dt> Is it reproducible? </dt>
      <dd>- Language-independent review </dd>
      <dd>- Receive feedback in 48-72 hours </dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dl>
      <dt> Is it auditable and understandable? </dt>
      <dd>- Language-dependent review </dd>
      <dd>- Receive feedback in 1 week </dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>
    <dl>
      <dt> Does it follow best practices? </dt>
      <dd>- Language-dependent review </dd>
      <dd>- Receive feedback in 1-2 weeks </dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
</ol>

For language-dependent review, our current team can help with projects using Python, R, MatLab, C++, Java, Linux, Docker, Singularity, and HTML/CSS.  

Please ensure that your review package includes: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ✓ A README file that describes the project; specifies credit and licensing

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ✓ Any outputs that the reviewers should try to reproduce

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ✓ All data used to create the outputs to be reproduced

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ✓ All code necessary to recreate the outputs

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ✓ A main script that runs any subscripts in the relevant order

We look forward to hearing from you and helping you with your submissions!
