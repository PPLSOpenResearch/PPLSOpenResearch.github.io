# Git and Github Workshop

Nov 23rd, 2023, 16:00-17:30 (BST), 7.01 DSB
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Demonstrators

* [**Ponrawee Prasertsom**](https://ponraw.ee/), PhD Student at the Centre for Language Evolution, PPLS Open Research Facilitator

## Event Description

Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes in files and folders. GitHub is a platform for Git that allows you to collaborate on projects and upload your files and folders tracked with Git along with their history. Both are effective tools for making your research process more transparent and open for future you, your collaborators, and other researchers interested in your work.

We will walk you through:
- How to make a start with version control using Git
- How to create and use a repository on Github

Prior to the workshop, please download and install Git. If you prefer working with the command line interface, please set it up [according to the instructions on this page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git). If you do not want to work with the command lines, or do not know what they are, simply install the [GitHub Desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/).
