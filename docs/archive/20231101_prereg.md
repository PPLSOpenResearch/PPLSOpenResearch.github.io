# Hands-on Workshop on Pre-registration

Nov 1st, 15:30-16:30 (BST), LG.08 40GS
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

## Speaker
* [**Ponrawee Prasertsom**](https://ponraw.ee/), PhD Student at the Centre for Language Evolution, PPLS Open Research Facilitator

In this event we will discuss what a pre-registration is and what it's for. We will then demonstrate how to start a pre-registration on ([OSF](https://www.cos.io/initiatives/prereg) and [As.predicted](https://aspredicted.org/)) and guide you through the important points.

As a hands-on workshop, you will have chance to either:

- Work together through an OSF pre-registration using a toy-example experiment, or
- Work on your own OSF pre-registration for your own research

In both cases you will be able to interact with fellow researchers, and we are there along the way to answer all questions you might have!
